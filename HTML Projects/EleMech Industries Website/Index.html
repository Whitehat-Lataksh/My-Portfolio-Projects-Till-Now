                                        alumina is used for a wide range of adsorbent and catalyst applications
                                        including
                                        the adsorption of catalysts in polyethylene production, in hydrogen peroxide
                                        production, as a selective adsorbent for many chemicals including arsenic,
                                        fluoride,
                                        in sulfur removal from fluid streams (Claus Catalyst process).

                                        Desiccant
                                        Used as a desiccant, it works by a process called adsorption. The water in the
                                        air
                                        actually sticks to the alumina itself in between the tiny passages as the air
                                        passes
                                        through them. The water molecules become trapped so that the air is dried out as
                                        it
                                        passes through the filter. This process is reversible. If the alumina desiccant
                                        is
                                        heated to ~200 °C, it will release the trapped water. This process is called
                                        regenerating the desiccant.

                                        Fluoride adsorbent
                                        Activated alumina is also widely used to remove fluoride from drinking water. In
                                        the
                                        US, there are widespread programs to fluoridate drinking water. However, in
                                        certain
                                        regions, such as the Rajasthan region of India, there is enough fluoride in the
                                        water to cause fluorosis. A study from the Harvard school of Public Health found
                                        exposure to fluoride as a child correlated with lower IQ.[1]

                                        Activated alumina filters can easily reduce fluoride levels from 10 ppm to less
                                        than
                                        1 ppm. The amount of fluoride leached from the water being filtered depends on
                                        how
                                        long the water is actually touching the alumina filter media. Basically, the
                                        more
                                        alumina in the filter, the less fluoride will be in the final, filtered water.
                                        Lower
                                        temperature water, and lower pH water (acidic water) are filtered more
                                        effectively
                                        too. Ideal pH for treatment is 5.5, which allows for up to a 95% removal rate.

                                        As per researches conducted by V.K.Chhabra, Chief Chemist (retd.) P.H.E.D.
                                        Rajasthan, activated alumina, when used as a fluoride filter, under field
                                        conditions
                                        can best be regenerated by a solution of lye (sodium hydroxide; NaOH), sulfuric
                                        acid
                                        (H2SO4).

                                        The fluoride uptake capacity (FUC) of activated alumina can be up to 5000 mg/kg.
                                        The
                                        FUC using V.K. Chhabra's method can be determined as follows:

                                        Fluoride solution: Dissolve 22.1 g anhydrous NaF in distilled water and dilute
                                        to
                                        1,000 mL. 1 mL = 10 mg fluoride. 10 mL/L = 100 mg/L fluoride.

                                        Procedure:

                                        To one litre of simulated distilled water containing 100 mg/L of fluoride,
                                        agitate
                                        at 100 rpm using the jar test machine. Add 10 g of the AA under test. After one
                                        hour, switch off the machine and take out the solution. After 5 minutes,
                                        carefully
                                        decant the supernatant solution and determine the fluoride. Calculate the
                                        difference
                                        between the original and treated water fluoride concentration. Multiply the
                                        difference by 100 to give the fluoride uptake capacity of AA in mg/kg.

                                        Vacuum systems
                                        In high vacuum applications, activated alumina is used as a charge material in
                                        fore-line traps to prevent oil generated by rotary vane pumps from back
                                        streaming
                                        into the system.[2]

                                        Biomaterial
                                        Its mechanical properties and non-reactivity in the biological environment allow
                                        it
                                        to be a suitable material used to cover surfaces in friction in body prostheses
                                        (e.g. hip or shoulder prostheses).

                                        Defluoridation is the downward adjustment of the level of fluoride in drinking
                                        water. Activated Alumina process is one of the widely used adsorption methods
                                        for
                                        the defluoridation of drinking water.
